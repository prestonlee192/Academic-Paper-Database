An Equilibrium Model of the Market for Bitcoin Modeling
  This paper seeks to characterize bitcoin mining as a general equilibrium model: 
  Key features:
  Technology: Mining is characterized as inherently random process of "guessing and checking" hashes until a 
  certain threshhold is met. Threshhold is determined dynamically by a difficulty parameter. Difficulty 
  parameter is set so that blocks are generated on average every 10 minutes to mimic Bitcoin's difficulty 
  algorithm.
